Getting data from controller into the view
    Strongly -typed views (@model)
        return View(model);

        most used

    loosely-tyed views
        ViewData, ViewBag
            ViewData['key] = value;
            Non-generic, so, we may need cast when accessing
            Like dictionary mapping object to pbject
            disappears across requests

            on controller
                ViewData['bestcustomer'] = customer;
            on view
            (cast)bestcustomer.Name
        ViewBag
            Different way to access ViewData
            "dynamic" type

            on controller
            ViewBag.bestcustomer = customer;

            on view
            bestcustomer.Name
        TempData (uses cookies by default)
            Used just like ViewData except, once inserted it's values stay across requests 
                untill they're first access
            
            TempData.Peek("key")
                but if you peek it won't be marked for deletion
